% ACTIVE_SEARCH_BOUND_SELECTOR selects only potentially optimal search points.
%
% This is an implementation of a selector for the MATLAB Active
% Learning Toolbox:
%
%   https://github.com/rmgarnett/active_learning
%
% that selects only those points that could have optimal l-step
% lookahead expected utility for the active search problem
% (corresponding to search_utility). These points are found by
% exploiting a bound on the future maximum probability after adding a
% given number of positive observations; see the following paper

% Usage:
%
%   test_ind = active_search_bound_selector(problem, train_ind, ...
%           observed_labels, model, probability_bound, lookahead)
%
% Inputs:
%
%             problem: a struct describing the problem, containing fields:
%
%                    points: an (n x d) data matrix for the available points
%               num_classes: the number of classes
%
%           train_ind: a list of indices into problem.points indicating
%                      the thus-far observed points
%     observed_labels: a list of labels corresponding to the
%                      observations in train_ind
%               model: a handle to the probability model to use
%   probability_bound: a handle to the probability bound to use (see
%                      expected_search_utility_bound for details)
%           lookahead: the number of steps of lookahead to consider
%
% Output:
%
%   test_ind: a list of indices into problem.points indicating the
%             points to consider for labeling
