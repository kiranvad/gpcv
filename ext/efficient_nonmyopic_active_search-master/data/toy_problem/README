It is the 2D world on grid; labels are generated using a Gaussian process + normcdf.
First a 2D function is sampled from the Gaussian process, then the function values are squashed using normcdf to get the probabilities of being positive.

There are two ways to generate the binary labels:
* deterministic labels: fixed a threshold (0.7), and set the label to be positive if the probability is greater than the threshold
* probabilistic labels: uniformly randomly sample a number from [0,6], and a point is set positive if the probability is greater than the random number
